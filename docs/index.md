Choreo is a KRM orchestration framework, leveraging the principles of kubernetes,  enabling the power of KRM as code or data. Choreo uses an event driven architecture that empowers flexible business logic




 With Choreo, orchestrating KRM resources becomes a easy through intuitive and human-readable configuration files. These files are not only reusable and shareable but can also be version-controlled, ensuring seamless collaboration among team members.

At its core, Choreo empowers you to manage the entire lifecycle of KRM resources specified through the configuration files consistently. Whether it's deployment, scaling, or any other operation, Kform streamlines the process for any resource modeled as KRM. This framework is designed to enhance efficiency and maintainability, making Kubernetes resource orchestration a straightforward and manageable task."

# Developer guide

The developper guide is designed to help developers extend Choreo with custom APIs and custom business logic (reconcilers) for their use cases.

## APIs

At the heart of `Choreo` are its APIs, which are implemented using Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). These CRDs extend Choreoâ€™s native capabilities, allowing developers to define custom resources specific to their needs. Each API in Choreo is designed to be self-descriptive and aligned with standard KRM practices, ensuring ease of use and integration.

## Reconcilers

Reconcilers are another pivotal component of `Choreo`. They attach to a resource in Choreo and react to resource changes triggering necessary updates and adjustments based on their business logic. Choreo support the following reconciler types right now.

- python/starlark
- go template
- jinja2 template
